## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install whiteout-survival-data
# or
pnpm add whiteout-survival-data
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Every module exports a **factory function** that returns a chainable query builder.

```ts
import { heroes } from "whiteout-survival-data";

heroes().findByName("Jeronimo");
```

_(placeholder — modules are being built out; see below)_

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

All standard modules follow the same **query builder pattern** built on a shared `QueryBase<T>`
class:

```ts
factory() // Start with all data
  .filterMethod() // Chain filters (returns new query)
  .sortMethod() // Chain sorts (returns new query)
  .terminalMethod(); // Get results
```

### Terminal Methods

Every query builder provides these 6 terminal methods:

| Method              | Returns          | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `.get()`            | `T[]`            | All results as an array               |
| `.first()`          | `T \| undefined` | First result                          |
| `.find(id)`         | `T \| undefined` | Find by exact ID                      |
| `.findByName(name)` | `T \| undefined` | Find by name (case-insensitive)       |
| `.search(query)`    | `T[]`            | Partial name match (case-insensitive) |
| `.count()`          | `number`         | Number of results                     |

## 📚 Modules

No data modules yet — this repository is currently just the base scaffold (build tooling, lint,
tests, and the shared `QueryBase<T>` query builder). Modules will be added and listed here as they
are built out.

---

## 📋 Raw Data Access

Once modules exist, JSON data files can be imported directly, without importing the JS/TS package:

```ts
import heroes from "whiteout-survival-data/data/heroes.json";
```
